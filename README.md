## Development

go run app.go
```

### Create scaffold
1. Go to http://localhost:5000
2. Fill the form for new scaffold
3. Press Create Scaffold button
4. Handler, Model, View files is autogenerated without writing a single line of code.
5. Copy the green & yellow lines that the terminal gives out. These lines are the code for auto-migrate and routing respectively. Add them to main function.

*Check the handler file as it might have one typo in some cases and also check the yellow lines as it assumes your database is stored in db variable which may also might not be the case everytime.*
Go to http://localhost:5000
