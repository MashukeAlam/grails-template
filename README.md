## Development

### Start the application 


```bash
go run app.go
```

### Create scaffold
1. Go to http://localhost:5000
2. Fill the form for new scaffold
3. Press Create Scaffold button
4. Handler, Model, View files is autogenerated without writing a single line of code.
5. Copy the green & yellow lines that the terminal gives out. These lines are the code for auto-migrate and routing respectively. Add them to main function.

*Check the handler file as it might have one typo in some cases and also check the yellow lines as it assumes your database is stored in db variable which may also might not be the case everytime.*

### Create scaffold (the old way)
**This method is buggy and no longer maintained. Use frontend to create whole scaffold with no code.**

Write less code and call generateMigrations. This will come to CLI soon.

```bash
tableName1 := "users"
fields1 := []Field{
	{Name: "name", Type: "VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL"},
	{Name: "email", Type: "VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE"},
}

// Generate the migration files
generateMigration(tableName1, fields1)

tableName2 := "tweets"
fields2 := []Field{
 	{Name: "body", Type: "VARCHAR(300) NOT NULL"},
 	{Name: "title", Type: "VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL"},
}

// Generate the migration files
generateMigration(tableName2, fields2)

```
WARNING: Remember to uncomment these lines after running once or they will keep adding .sql files.

**This code will return the automigrate code and routing codes in the terminal. Paste those in the main function.**

### Run migrations using goose

If you are not using Gorm automigrate, you can use goose. that way you can migrate up & down. This feature is not tested so use with caution. Ensure Goose in PATH.
```bash
go run app.go migrate up
```


Go to http://localhost:5000
